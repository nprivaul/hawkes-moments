# hawkes-moments
This repository contains Maple, Mathematica and Sage codes for the computation of the cumulants, moments, joint moments, joint cumulants, and multidimensional cumulants and moments of all orders of Hawkes processes with exponential kernel
This also includes the moments and cumulants of stochastic integrals of deterministic functions with respect to (multidimentional) Hawkes processes.
